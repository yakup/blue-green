Blue-Green Deployment
===
https://botleg.com/stories/blue-green-deployment-with-docker/
This repository contains the files for the docker image [hanzel/blue-green](https://hub.docker.com/r/hanzel/blue-green/), that will create blue-green deployment. It uses nginx using consul template. It requires [consul](https://hub.docker.com/r/gliderlabs/consul-server/) as the key value store and [registrator](https://hub.docker.com/r/gliderlabs/registrator/) service running in each host. It works with docker swarm and multi-host networking.

Usage

* `BLUE_NAME`: The container name that we want as the blue service. Default: `blue`.
* `GREEN_NAME`: The container name that we want as the green service. Default: `green`.
* `LIVE`: The service that is in production initially. Default: `blue`.
* `CONSUL_URL`: URL endpoint for consul instance.
